# DATA601-Midterm

## Overview

## Goals

- Identify the traits that factor into a superlative school
- Determine if geographic factors have any impact on school performance
- Create a model that scores 85% or better

## Motivation & Background

I'm interested in open government and open data and I want to better understand the services offered to citizens.  I am a former Chicago resident and this dataset overlaps with my last year in the city.

My mother was an educator, as is my mother-in-law.  I'm also the father of kindergarteners, so understanding how to identify the traits of good schools is of personal interest.
